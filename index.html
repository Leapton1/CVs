    <br>
    I am a student at Sussex university studying computer science, and looking for relevant work. I believe that I would thrive in any job that requires strong technical skills or good communication, and that my past experience is an excellent indicator of my abilities. I specialise in website building, but have experience with retail, teaching and group coding projects. I believe that I’m an authentic and approachable human being, open to trying new things. <br>
    <br>
Work experience: <br>
Tutoring at Funtech - Over the 2023 summer holidays, I worked as a tutor for FunTech, a company that specialises in teaching technical and computational skills to young children. This displays excellent communication skills when discussing subjects that others may not be familiar with, as well as the ability to deescalate. It also displays that I’m able to be confident in my technical knowledge and ability to adapt to any situation. <br>
Retail at AgeUK - I also volunteered at the charity shop AgeUK for over 6 months, working the front desk as retail, where I was trusted to handle money and deal with difficult situations independently. <br>
I also helped create the 2024 HackSussex coders cup, a livestreamed event that currently sits at over 800k views, showing my ability to work in a team and ensure quality. <br>
<br>
Education: <br>
I am currently studying at the university of Sussex for an MComp in computer science, 2023-2027. My previous qualifications include A-levels at Graveney sixth form in computer science, maths and physics, as well as an array of relevant GCSEs at Graveney school. <br>
<br>
Skills: <br>
I am proficient in python, particularly at the back end, and am skilled at the usage of flask (a library used to run online servers for websites, allowing information storage across devices); some cloud website hosting software (particularly one called Render); and databases.  <br>
I am also experienced in front end JavaScript and CSS, and can confidently build websites and even multiplayer games using JavaScript.  <br>
I have some experience using Java. <br>
<br>
Other exploits: <br>
I have previously won an award for the best implementation of MongoDB Atlas (a cloud based database software), in the HackSussex game jam; an event with over 60 participants, alongside 2 other team members. This shows my technical skills and ability to work effectively as a team. <br>
I have also participated in the HackSussex hackathon, an event with over 200 participants. <br>
I currently sit as part of the HackSussex committee as welfare officer, demonstrating my interpersonal skills and organisation. <br>
